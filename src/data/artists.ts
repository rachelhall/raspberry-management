    name: "Saint Misty",
    bio: "Saint Misty, the musical project of Mikayla Gallagher, is a synth-pop artist based in San Diego, originally from Sacramento, CA. Her music explores her journey of leaving her religious upbringing and later a christian cult, ultimately embracing her identity as a lesbian. Drawing inspiration from punk, 70s, and 80s pop, Saint Misty creates a sound that’s both nostalgic and fresh, blending catchy synths with clever lyrics. Her goal is to uplift and empower the LGBTQ+ and women’s communities that helped her find her purpose and identity. Through her music, she brings the girls together, offering both healing and celebration of authenticity.",

    slug: "daddy",
    name: "Daddy",
    bio: "Meet the intoxicating & sparkly indie rock brainchild of vocalist/guitarist Brooke Patterson and bassist Jessica Taylor; two high school acquaintances turned best Pals. This vibrant, queer indie pop-rock trio takes the undying, resentful spirit of emo music, sends it to therapy, and injects it into a punchy sonic landscape filled with melodic basslines, confessional lyricism, and cathartic hooks. Following their 2023 debut, Daddy has quickly made a splashy entrance into the Southern California music scene, with a reputation for packing venues at their vibrant, themed party shows. They just released their debut EP, “Hell, Ohio” on 02/28/25; available now on all major streaming platforms.",
