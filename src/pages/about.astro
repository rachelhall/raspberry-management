            Natalie Bancroft founded Raspberry Management in 2017 in Nashville,
            TN, while helping candy pop darlings, Mariela, grow from just a
            couple kids learning to use Logic in their bedrooms into some of
            Nashville's best beloved indie sweethearts. RM has since developed
            into one of southern California's boutique indie artist management
            groups.
