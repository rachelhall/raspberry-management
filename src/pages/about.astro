        <p style="color:black;">
            Natalie Bancroft founded Raspberry Management in 2017 in Nashville,
            TN, while helping candy pop darlings, Mariela, grow from just a
            couple kids learning to use Logic in their bedrooms into some of
            Nashville's most beloved indie sweethearts. RM has since developed
            into one of southern California's favorite boutique artist
            management groups.
        </p>
        <p style="color:black;">
            RM is a collective of like-minded individuals, united by our primary
            focus: to develop sustainable careers and long-lasting legacies for
            our artists, and along the way, influence the musical landscape for
            the better. Our diverse roster features many uniquely talented
            artists from all genres including: Mariela, Emerson, Thomas Nixon,
            and Flower Creek. The same entrepreneurial spirit that guides our
            artist development extends into the fields of touring, commerce,
            festivals, licensing, branded entertainment, and artist-driven
            philanthropy.
