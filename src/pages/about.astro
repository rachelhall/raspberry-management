        <p style="color:black;">
            Coran Capshaw founded Red Light Management in 1991 in
            Charlottesville, VA, while helping Dave Matthews Band grow
            organically from local club favorite to one of the most renowned
            touring groups of all time. Red Light has since developed into the
            largest independent music management company in the world. Weâ€™re a
            collective of like-minded individuals, international in scope,
            united by our primary focus: to develop sustainable careers and
            long-lasting legacies for our artists, and along the way, influence
            the musical landscape for the better. Our diverse roster features
            many uniquely talented artists from all genres including: Dave
            Matthews Band, Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie, Enrique Iglesias, Dierks
            Bentley, ODESZA, Chris Stapleton, Lady A, The Strokes and Phish. The
            same entrepreneurial spirit that guides our artist development
            extends into the fields of touring, commerce, festivals, licensing,
            branded entertainment, and artist-driven philanthropy.
