            Natalie Bancroft founded Raspberry Management in 2017 working out at
            The Sweetbriar in Nashville, TN, while helping candy pop darlings
            Mariela grow from just a couple kids learning to use Logic in their
            bedroom into one of Nashville's best beloved local sweethearts. RM
            has since developed into southern California's boutique indie artist
            management groups.
